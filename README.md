## One for FOSS and FOSS for one.

As responsible software developers and companies, we know... we would make zero money without the FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) that powers our work. That's why **we pledge to donate 1% of our profits to the FOSS we use**, to help cover the costs of maintenance. We consider it both our responsibility and our privilege.

**Will you join us?**
