# How to Adopt

**Step 1. Look at your profits for the past year**. We recommend you start by donating 1% of that, you can reconsider next year. 

**Step 2. Make a list of the Free and Open Source Software you use.** If you're using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), this could be as easy as running `composer fund` in one of your projects.

**Step 3. Determine who needs your help more.** Look at their Github Sponsors page or any other donation method they use. Understand how much money they're already receiving and if they have any other sources of income (premium versions, SaaS etc.). Reorder your list, so that your money is directed towards the projects that would most benefit from it.

**Step 4. Donate.** Give however you prefer - one-time, monthly, weekly, whatever. But take into consideration that most maintainers would love a steady revenue stream from the FOSS, no strings attached. [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) is a simple way for you to do just that... both for the maintainer and for you. It will just add your monthly donation to your monthly Github payment.  

**Step 5. Sign the manifesto.** Add your name to our [`SIGNATORIES.md`](https://github.com/tabacitu/one-for-foss/blob/master/signatories.md) file. This way, you _publicly_ commit to donating 1% to FOSS, from this point foward. It will keep you accountable, to some degree.

**Step 6. Spread the word.** We bet you know others who can do this - so tell them about it. Give this repo a star on GitHub and be vocal about this initiative - both privately and publicly. We encourage you to brag about it - if it helps people follow your lead.

**Step 7. Check back next year.** We'll add a way for you to confirm your ongoing involvement.
